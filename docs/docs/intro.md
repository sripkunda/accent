# Introduction

Let's get started with Accent.js in **less than two minutes.**

## What is Accent?

Accent.js is a lightweight, easy-to-use, and **fully modular** web development framework built for simplicity. All Accent libraries are standalone and can be
used by themselves whenever necessary.

When libraries are used together, they work together to provide a full toolset for building your web application. Accent is your toolbox, and you choose the best tool(s) for the job. Accent currently is made up of **4 independent libraries.**

## Installation

Accent.js can be installed through a CDN or through NPM. Build tools are not required to use Accent.js, although the official CLI is recommended when using the Accent.js Router.

#### NPM Installation

```shell
npm install @accent/[library-name]
```

#### CDN

**Ensure that all Accent.js libraries are included **before** any additional JavaScript logic.** The order that the libraries are included in does not matter.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@accent/[library-name]"></script>
```

Replace `<library-name>` with the name of the library you wish to install. A full list of Accent.js libraries can be found [here](fundamentals/modularity#list-of-libraries).
